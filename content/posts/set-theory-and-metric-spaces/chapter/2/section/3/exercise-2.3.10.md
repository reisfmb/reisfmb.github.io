### Pergunta
(Distance between sets): Let $A$ and $B$ be sets in a metric space. Define $D(A,B)$ to be $\inf D(a,b)$ where the $\inf$ is taken over all $a \in A$, $b \in B$. Observe that $D(A,B) = 0$ if $A$ and $B$ have a point in common, but that condition is not necessary.

a) If $B$ consists of a single point $x$, prove that $D(A,B) = 0$ if and only if $x$ is in the closure of $A$.

b) Give an example where $A$ and $B$ are both closed, $A \cap B$ is empty, and $D(A,B) = 0$. (Suggestion: a hyperbola and its asymptotes.)
